<!-- *One way of writing JavaScript is writing in the script tage of the html ... this is called inline script. The other way is use an external file and link the HTML file with the JavaScript file -->
<!-- 
*DO NOT USE INLINE SCRIPT BECAUSE...
	- it's difficult to maintain the code 
	- it's better to separate the logic for HTML and JavaScript in separate places 
*SO CREATE A NEW FILE with .js -->
